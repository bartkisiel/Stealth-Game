# Stealth-Game
One level simple 3D stealth game made in Unity using C# for educational purposes.

The game currently has only one playable stage and it's quite simple. At this moment I probably won't add any more levels but will move forward to another, more complex project. However this is how I designed the map.

Watch the video below to see how it works. Every guard has less than one second to spot the player when he cames into his visibility zone represented by spotlight. Player may use the walls as covers to reach his target which is small object on the ground hidden somewhere in the room.
